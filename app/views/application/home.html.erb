        There are so many file sharing tools out there. Why should you use this
        one? I think Data Dead Drop is a bit special. Here is why:

          Data Dead Drop is built with machines and automation in mind. No need
          for browsers, just bring your favorite command line client. We
          recommend

          Your data is safe by design. Secure links are generated using the

    <%= render "components/faq",

        The short answer is
        <strong>yes</strong>. The long answer is that we use an encrypted AWS bucket to store your
        data at rest. Secure links are generated with
        <% render "components/link",
        name: "the diceware algorithm",
        url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware" %>
        using three words. In theory these links are guessable. With really
        powerful hardware you could guess a given link in
        <% render "components/link",
        name: "about nine days",
        url:
          "https://blog.1password.com/posts/2013/1password-hashcat-strong-master-passwords/hashcat-crack-times.png" %>
        - that is without ignoring network latency. In practice, it is highly
        unlikely to guess a given link.

    <%= render "components/faq",

        Data Dead Drop was created to easily exchange keys or secrets between
        independent computer systems. However, it would be useful for anyone
        who requires anonymous, quick and secure data sharing that can't be
        traced. Keep in mind that this service is not to be used for long term
        storage, there are different services for that.

    <%= render "components/faq",
    title: "Can I upload anything?" do |partial| %>
      <% partial.content do %>
        We limit the size of uploads to 1MB. By uploading data you agree to our
        terms and conditions. Data Dead Drop reserveres the right to delete any
        data that is deemed illegal or inappropriate and take steps to block
        users who upload such data.

        name: "GitHub",
        url: "https://github.com/hschne/data-dead-drop" %>
        to report an issue or send an

        Data Dead Drop is cheap to run, thanks to utilizing a lean stack based
        on SQlite and Ruby on Rails. Still, I appreciate the gesture. There are
        currently no paid plans for using Data Dead Drop, but feel free to
